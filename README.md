#Scripts for Scriptographer
http://scriptographer.org


Tools created to be used on Scriptographer, a plugin for Adobe Illustrator. Unfortunately Scriptographer is incompatible with CS6, and [@scriptographer](https://twitter.com/scriptographer) dev team has since stopped the development.

If you're not familiar with Scriptographer already, here's a introductory tutorial I wrote:
